v1.0.5 (2015-03-06)
-------------------

(Due to my incompetence this message was never shown. 1.0.6 was released with
no actual changes just to show this message.)

* Few fixes for syntax definitions, e.g. \" escape sequence in key maps
* Now bundles default settings for YAML syntax definitions (including
  `auto_complete_triggers` and `tab_width`)


A few bugfix releases have been published previously without showing the
changelog. They are included below:

* The build process is now aborted early if errors from the loader and dumper
  are detected. Especially useful if you were using the "Convert ... and
  rearrange YAML def" command and were working with an invalid source file.
* Fixed escaped backslashes in sublime settings syntax
~ File conversion now saves the file before building (and fails when saving
  does)
* Stop the build if the user closed the "select target format" panel
* Some minor bugfixes

For changes to the sublime_lib (which are largely uninteresting), refer to the
more verbose messages in the package, e.g. on github.
