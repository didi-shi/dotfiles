v2.0.0 (2016-01-24)
-------------------

## The Big Changes

* Renamed to just "PackageDev".
  This mostly noticable in syntax definition paths
  (you may need to re-set syntaxes for open files)
  and the command palette.

- Removed `sublime_lib` from the "official API".
  You can ignore this if you don't know what it is.
  To clarify, it is still there (internally) for the time begin,
  but it is not exposed anymore.


## The Small Changes

- Removed "New * Syntax to Buffer" commands
* Respect user's indentation settings when creating a new completions or
  commands file
* Added a notice for when Plists can not be parsed on ST2 and specific Linux
  distros
* A few completions changes
+ More entries in Main menu file

And from previous update 1.0.8, which didn't show an update message:

* Fixed highlighting of string escape sequences in Key Maps (@MattDMo)
+ Added highlighting of keys "bundleUUID", "author", "keyEquivalent",
  "foldingStartMarker", "foldingStopMarker" and "fistLineMatch" for YAML syntax
  definitions (@MattDMo)


## For package developers that used `sublime_lib` (or are interested in it)

We intend to make the functionality (with changes) available as a dependency
for Package Control. If you would like to suggest features that the module
should have, please raise your voice here:
