v1.0.7 (2015-07-13)
-------------------

* Exceptions while parsing or dumping are not eaten anymore and can be seen in
  the console. As a result, the "conversion (un-)successful" message, which
  previously said the exact opposite of what actually happend, only shows up
  for success. (#55)
* Fixed small issues with YAML Syntax Def highlighting (#58, #46)
* Added a few cleanups for YAML scalar detections in rearrange command. `(?x)`
  patterns are now dedented and single-quoted scalars are preferred due to more
  complex escape mechanisms in double-quoted scalars.
* File is not marked as dirty anymore after converting&rearranging.
+ Added "punctuation" scopes to completions. Punctuation scopes don't have any
  standards yet, so feel free to suggest different names on github.
- Removed "New Package" command. It hasn't been working for three years anyway.
  The "Delete Package" command has been removed as well, since it hasn't been
  updated for ST3's .sublime-package workflow. (#4, #54)
